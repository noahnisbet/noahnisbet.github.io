Reseach Question: Are the sizes of wildfires and CO2 emissions correlated?

In this post, I will be talking about the relationship between CO2 emissions worldwide and the increasing size of wildfires in California. I chose this topic because I've been seeing the California wildfires all over the news and I am genuinely interested in the relationship between CO2 emissions and wildfires. The fires have been rapidly growing in California and so much so, that the past two years have had the most extensive wildfires ever recorded.  When I first heard about the fires I was looking up articles, and I couldn't find much data on how global warming relates to the wildfires. I'm not an environmental scientist so I don't know exactly how the CO2 in the air would cause wildfires. But, I can find out if there is a correlation between CO2 emissions and wildfires using data science.

For my project, I started by searching for databases containing statistics of wildfires in the past years. I found reliable data on Cal Fire and moved on to CO2 statistics. I used a site that a fellow student shared to me called The World Bank and it had an excel spreadsheet of every country's CO2 emissions for the past forty years. I began to clean the data sets and get them useable for my analysis.
  
I started my analysis by graphing my data. I started with the simple graph below. It shows the CO2 released worldwide per year on top a graph of the number of acres burned by wildfires in California per year. I did this because it makes it easier to see if they have similar trends, and it looks like they do. The graph shows a positive correlation. The graph also shows that as CO2 emissions go up the bad wildfire years get worse and the good wildfire years stay similar and even seem to be longer. I don't know why this would be the case. Perhaps after a bad wildfire year, there isn't much left to burn, but I found that feature particularly interesting about this graph.

In my next graph I made a scatter plot of worldwide CO2 emissions vs acres burned by wildfires. I then plotted a best fit line of the data in the graph. The best fit line showed a positive trend and the correlation coefficient between worldwide CO2 emissions and acres burned by wildfires was .56 meaning a moderate correlation. This graph solidates the positive trend I saw in the previous graph. Overall confirming the relationship between CO2 emissions and size of wildfires in California.

In conclusion, these two graphs and my analysis of the data showed a positive correlation between the acres burned by wildfires in California and worldwide CO2 emissions. While this does not conclusively show that they are directly related, the correlation suggests that they have an impact on each other. This implies that an effort to control one or the other may lead to a reduction in the other variable. For example, the United Nations creating global CO2 emissions reform could reduce the number of acres burned by wildfires in California. Overall, this subject is one that I believe deserves to be explored more and could be valuable for leading world conservationists looking to help lessen the effects of climate change.
